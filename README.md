# Graph-to-Text-Summarization-Using-GNNs-and-GPT

Designed and implemented a graph-to-text generation pipeline that translates social network graphs into natural language summaries using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for structured data encoding with GPT for text
synthesis. Extracted high-dimensional node and edge embeddings using GNNs to capture relationship patterns and topological context within the graph. Fine-tuned GPT to generate interpretable descriptions from graph embeddings. Example: Input graph with connections like "Alice → Bob, Alice → Carol" yields: "Alice is friends with Bob and Carol."
